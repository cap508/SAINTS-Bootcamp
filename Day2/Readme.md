# Day 2

Today we are going to look at a number of libraries which are available in Python to undertake some useful tasks we might want to do during our research.
We will also look at a new environment called Jupyter notebooks and particularly the Google Colab system which allows us to run these notebooks online.

We will see that these libraries can be incredibly powerful and that, with very little knowledge, and only a few lines of Python, we can create some
really useful scripts.
