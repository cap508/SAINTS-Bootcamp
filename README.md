# SAINTS-Bootcamp


This course is aimed at students joining the SAINTS CDT who have little or no programming experience. The aim of the course is to get you to a point where you are comfortable in reading and writing Python code. Through this course we will look at the basic structure of Python programs as well as the core programming constructs. We will then investigate the use of Python for Data handling, Data Visualization and evaluating simple ML models. 


You will learn how to work in both an integrated development environment (VSCode) and a interactive environment for data exploration (Jupyter Notebooks).
