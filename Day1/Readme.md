# Day 1 - Getting Started with Python

Welcome to this introductory course for Python. Today you will learn what programming is all about and why you should bother to learn it. You'll learn how Python is accessed on a computer and how to write lines of Python code. 
You'll discover how to access Python in the command terminal to run individual commands and how to use VScode as an editor to create, and run, larger Python programs.

Today's primary material is in the form of a PDF which we will walk through together.

Take your time and make sure you understand what's happening before you move on.

If anything is unclear, then please ask.

Colin.
