# Day 3

Today we are going to look at data modelling and then look at machine learning. You will see that with the use of Python and some selected libraries the amount of code you have to write is very limited.You will see that making these models is not a particularly difficult 'practical' task and that the real skill comes in choosing the correct data and models. Indeed this thinking which underlies the construction of good ML models is easy to over look.

It's not my intention to make you into AI experts in this part of the course, you'll ahve other modules for that, instead I want to give you some insights into how Python can be used in the data modelling and machine learning tasks.
